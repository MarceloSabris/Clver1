Abstract

With the advance of technology, there are new ways of teaching that break the barrier of time and place; distance education can be considered as the most advanced model at this time, however you may bring difficulties if you need support an advisory and/or guardian by the student at a given time and this is not available. To solve this problem a technological tool that behaves like a teacher in both the teaching strategy and mastery of subject teaching is required, guiding the student on how to apply this knowledge in their individual characteristics. Intelligent tutoring systems simulate the behavior of a human tutor, using Artificial Intelligence techniques in order to provide the student the required cognitive support for learning. In this work, the creation of an Intelligent Tutorial System for the teaching of Engineering in Computer Science and distance many students at once using Artificial Intelligence techniques is proposed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Field-Weighted Citation Impact Field-Weighted Citation Impact shows how well cited this document is when compared to similar documents. A value greater than 1.00 means the document is more cited than expected according to the average. It takes into account:

    The year of publication
    Document type, and
    Disciplines associated with its source.

The FWCI is the ratio of the document's citations to the average number of citations received by all similar documents over a three-year window. Each discipline makes an equal contribution to the metric, which eliminates differences in researcher citation behavior.
